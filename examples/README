DET_COMPRESS examples
=====================
This directory contains examples to test DET_COMPRESS on.


List of examples
----------------
* li_50csf       : 50-CSF expansion for the lithium atom, generated by
                   ATSP2k.
* li_500csf      : 500-CSF expansion for the lithium atom, generated
                   by ATSP2k.
* ne_50csf       : 50-CSF expansion for the neon atom, generated by
                   ATSP2k.
* ne_500csf      : 500-CSF expansion for the neon atom, generated by
                   ATSP2k.
* be2_61csf      : 61-CSF expansion for the Be2 molecule, generated by
                   GAMESS-US.
* model_two_iter : an 8-determinant expansion that compresses to a
                   single determinant in two compression iterations,
                   purely for testing purposes.

Contents
--------
Each directory contains an mdet.casl file and a cmdet.casl file:
* The mdet.casl file is the input file for DET_COMPRESS, which
  describes of the multi-determinant expansion to be compressed.
* The cmdet.casl file is the output file of DET_COMPRESS, which
  describes the compressed expansion.
The cmdet.casl files were generated using the 'd' operational mode.
Running DET_COMPRESS in any of the example directories will overwrite
the existing cmdet.casl file.

Additionally, the lithium and neon examples contain the CASINO
awfn.data and correlation.data files from which the mdet.casl files
were generated.  See the det_compress/interface directory for a
demonstration tool that performs this conversion.
