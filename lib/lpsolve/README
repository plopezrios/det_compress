LP_SOLVE
========

This directory contains the relevant files to compile a static version
of the lp_solve library.  Here we simply gather the necessary C source
and header files in the lp_solve source in a single directory; this
can be re-done with:

 cd $LPSOLVE_SOURCE_DIR
 cp {.,shared,colamd,bfp,bfp/bfp_LUSOL,bfp/bfp_LUSOL/LUSOL}/*.{c,h}\
  $CASINO_DIR/lib/lpsolve

Currently the source is based on lp_solve 5.5.  Using a different
version may require changing the Makefile; the Makefile here was
derived from the information in the library compilation script
$LPSOLVE_SOURCE_DIR/lpsolve55/ccc .

Note that the build system allows users to use the system's lp_solve
library if so they wish.

License and compliance
======================

lp_solve is licensed under the LGPL 2.1.  A copy of the text of the

as well as at:

We distribute a partial, verbatim copy of the source of lp_solve,
along with our custom build system.  This can be classified as a
"work based on the library" in the license's terms, and remains
licensed under the LGPL 2.1.

The utilities that make use of this library are "work that use the
library" in the license's terms, and they are licensed under our own
license, but can be easily recompiled against a modified version of
the library.

We believe in good faith that our distribution and use of the lp_solve
library complies with the terms of the LGPL 2.1.
