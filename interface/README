Interfacing with DET_COMPRESS
=============================
This directory contains code demonstrating how to write the mdet.casl
files required by DET_COMPRESS and how to read the cmdet.casl files
it produces.

WRITE_MDET
==========
The write_mdet/src directory contains a demonstration program that
reads CASINO awfn.data and correlation.data files and produces an
mdet.casl file.  The code can be compiled by changing into the
write_mdet/src directory and typing 'make', and the binary will appear
as write_mdet/bin/write_demo.

To test the compiled binary, change into an example directory and run
the binary, e.g.,

  cd ../../../examples/li_50csf
  ../../interface/write_mdet/bin/write_demo

Note that this will overwrite the mdet.casl file already present in
the example directory.
